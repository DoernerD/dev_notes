# Web Dev

Since my webpage runs currently on github pages, here are some resources on
everything related to it...

## Tutorials

- [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) I mainly followed that one.

## Serve develop server

To only serve the jekyll site locally, i.e. on the development branch

    jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
