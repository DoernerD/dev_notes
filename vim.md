## Writing mode

    :Goyo

Goyo is a nice plugin for distraction free writing. It removes all noise and 
centeres the view. Makes writing at least mark down quite fun. Haven't tried 
writing latex yet though...

## Word Count

To count words, select the section you're interested in. Then

   g, Ctrl-g

This shows you the number of words in the selected section. Pressing just

    g, Ctrl-g

shows the word count of the complete file.


## Following Links

Embarassing that I have to write this, but usually I don't use that feature...
To follow a link, e.g. in the help window, press

    Ctrl-]

Once you're done, return to the previous page with

    Ctrl-T
    
## Jumping to previous position

Sometimes, after using gg or so, you might want to jump back to the previous
postition. Super easy, just press

    ``
    
## Moving backwards

To move backward to the beginning of a word, use

    b
    

## Colorschemes

To change color schemes temporarily, use

    :colorscheme <schemeName>
